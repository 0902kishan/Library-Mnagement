This code implements a basic Library Management System using C++. It provides functionality to manage books and students, including adding records, issuing books, and returning books. The system uses file handling to save data persistently and employs a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

Components and Functionality
1. Book Class
The Book class manages book-related information and operations:

Attributes:
bookID: A unique identifier for the book.
title: Title of the book.
author: Author of the book.
price: Price of the book.
quantity: Number of copies available.
Methods:
accept(): Accepts details of the book from the user.
saveToFile(): Saves book details to a file (books.txt) for persistent storage.
getBookID(): Returns the bookID.
getQuantity(): Returns the number of available copies.
updateQuantity(int qty): Updates the quantity by adding or subtracting the provided qty.
2. Student Class
The Student class manages student-related information:

Attributes:
enroll: Enrollment number of the student.
name: Name of the student.
branch: Branch/department of the student.
semester: Current semester of the student.
mobileNumber: Contact number of the student.
Methods:
accept(): Accepts student details from the user.
saveToFile(): Saves student details to a file (students.txt) for persistent storage.
getEnroll(): Returns the enrollment number of the student.
3. Issue and Return Functions
issueBook(vector<Book> &books, const string &bookID): Issues a book by decreasing its quantity if it exists and has stock.
If the bookID matches a book in the collection and its quantity is greater than 0, the book is issued.
If the book is out of stock or not found, appropriate messages are displayed.
returnBook(vector<Book> &books, const string &bookID): Returns a book by increasing its quantity.
If the bookID matches a book in the collection, its quantity is incremented.
If the book is not found, an error message is displayed.
4. main() Function
The entry point of the program implements a menu-driven interface to interact with the system:

Menu Options:

1. Add Book: Allows the user to add a new book to the collection.
2. Add Student: Allows the user to register a new student.
3. Issue Book: Facilitates issuing a book by its bookID.
4. Return Book: Facilitates returning a book by its bookID.
5. Exit: Terminates the program.
User Interaction:

A do-while loop ensures the menu is displayed repeatedly until the user chooses to exit.
A switch statement handles the userâ€™s choice, invoking appropriate functions.
Key Features
Persistent Storage:

Books and students are saved in text files (books.txt and students.txt) to retain data across sessions.
Dynamic Collections:

vector<Book> and vector<Student> are used to manage books and students dynamically.
Error Handling:

Displays messages for invalid operations, such as issuing a book that is out of stock or returning a book not in the system.
Menu-Driven Interface:

A simple and intuitive menu makes the system easy to navigate for users.
Limitations
Data Retrieval:

Books and students are not loaded from files into vectors at startup, so the program only works with records added during the session.
Validation:

Input validation is minimal; errors such as invalid numbers or special characters might not be handled correctly.
Concurrency:

If multiple users use the system simultaneously, conflicts may arise due to file overwrites.
Scalability:

Managing large datasets with text files can be inefficient compared to database solutions.
Suggestions for Improvement
Data Loading:

Implement functionality to load books and students from their respective files into memory at program startup.
Enhanced Validation:

Add checks to ensure the correctness of user input, such as validating the format of the enrollment number and mobile number.
File Handling:

Use structured file formats like JSON or binary files for better efficiency and data integrity.
Advanced Features:

Add functionalities such as searching for books/students, updating book details, and viewing all issued books.
Database Integration:

Replace text files with a database to manage data more robustly and efficiently.
